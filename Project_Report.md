# AVCAD Final Project - Analysis of livestock activities: geographical patterns
### Created by: Maria Dolgaya (28168) and Mariana Coelho (25605)
### Professor Pedro Segurado
### MSc in Green Data Science, ISA, Portugal

Objectives: 
1) explore how different types of livestock change across the country;
2) how these types of livestock are related with the geographical patterns of socio-economic indicators

**Introduction** – Short introduction to the topic, ending with questions/working hypothesis to be addressed and objective (2 pages max.)

Data analysis and visualization are two important concepts that are increasingly emerging through the years. The first refers to the process of inspecting, cleaning, transforming, and modeling data with the goal of discovering useful information, informing conclusions, and supporting decision-making (Brown, 2014) and the second refers to the process of graphically representing information and data aiming at placing complex data in a visual format to facilitate real-time interpretation. 
With these important processes in mind, it’s possible to get a better understanding of how the way we treat data and how we present it to a certain audience can vary from situation to situation.  For example, an audience composed of scientists is much different than an audience composed of artists. So with this, we can affirm that data analysis and data visualization allows us to tell a coherent story from a certain complex dataset. In this project, that was what we were challenged to do.
Using the National Institute for Statistics (Instituto Nacional de Estatística, INE) database, we were able to extract relevant and complex agro-environmental data and with it, tell a story regarding the agro-environmental occurrences in Portugal.
The topic chosen by me and my colleague was the analysis of livestock activities, taking into consideration the geographical patterns. We were tasked with two main objectives: explore how different types of livestock change across the country and understand and try to explain to our audience how these types of livestock are related with the geographical patterns of socio-economic indicators.

**Database description** – Short descriptive statistics of the database/tables (2 page max.)

The database being used is the INE one that was provided to us by the professor. This database consists of 9 important variables: Education, Workforce, Production, Livestock, Grasslands, Temporary crops, Permanent cultures, Spatial resolution and Temporal window. With these variables in mind, we were able to choose the ones most suitable to our topic and work with the data that was considered relevant for us. The variables most relevant for us were Education, Workforce, Production, Livestock and Grasslands. From the original dataset, we used the python package Pandas to create a dataframe with only those variables so it would be easier to work with.

**Exploratory data analysis** – This will be the most important chapter, where you will try to tell a coherent history by means of numerical outputs and visualizations (10 pages max.)

**Discussion/Conclusions** – a short discussion/main take home messages/conclusions of the work (2 pages max.).
